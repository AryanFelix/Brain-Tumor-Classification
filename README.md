# Brain Tumor Classifier
A Brain Tumor Classification and Segmentation tool to easily detect from Magnetic Resonance Images or MRI. It works on a Convolutional Neural Network created using Keras.

## Model Metrics
* Accuracy: 97%
* Validation Accuracy: 91%
* Loss: 6%
* Validation Loss: 38%

## Steps to Run
1. Train the model by running all the cells in `TrainingBTClassifier.ipynb`.
2. In `Main.ipynb`, change the value of `img_path` to the location of your MRI Image.
3. Run all other cells of `Main.ipynb`

## Dataset
* BraTS 2019
    
    BraTS has always been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
